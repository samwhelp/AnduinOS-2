# AnduinOS Dynamic Dconf Configuration
#
# Static dconf/gschema/GDM defaults are shipped by the
# anduinos-dconf-defaults Apkg package (installed by mod 01).
# This mod only handles build-time dynamic configs that vary
# per locale (weather location).
#
# Keyboard layout is NOT set here — GNOME reads /etc/default/keyboard
# (set by Ubiquity during install), so each user gets their own layout.
#
# The dconf update at the end compiles all fragments — including
# those shipped by individual Apkg extension packages — into the
# final system database.
